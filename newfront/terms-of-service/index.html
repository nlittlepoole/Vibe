        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Date of Last Revision: October 28, 2013</p>

<p>HookFeed provides its Service (as defined below) to you through its website located at <a href="../index.html">http://www.hookfeed.com</a> (the "Site"), subject to this Terms of Service agreement ("TOS"). By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service or Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS. If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company, business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this TOS, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you must not accept this TOS and may not use the Service.</p>

<p>HookFeed may change this TOS from time to time. If we do this, we will post the changes to this TOS on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Service user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new TOS.</p>

<p>The "Service" includes (a) the Site, (b) [HookFeed's application integration and data collection services and related technologies], and (c) any software (including the Software, as defined below), data, reports, text, images, sounds, video, and content made available through any of the foregoing (collectively referred to as the "Content"). Any new features added to or augmenting the Service are also subject to this TOS.</p>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS, you may access and use the Service only for lawful purposes. All rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components will remain with and belong exclusively to HookFeed. You shall not (a) display, distribute, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any third party; (b) use the Service in any unlawful manner (including without limitation in violation of any data, privacy or export control laws) or in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Service or its components, or (c) modify, adapt or hack the Service to, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks. You shall comply with any codes of conduct, policies or other notices HookFeed provides you or publishes in connection with the Service, and you shall promptly notify HookFeed if you learn of a security breach related to the Service.</p>

<p>Any software that may be made available by HookFeed in connection with the Service ("Software") contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS, HookFeed hereby grants you, where applicable, a personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive right and license to use the object code of any Software on a single device solely in connection with the Service, provided that you shall not (and shall not allow any third party to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or sell, assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any right in any Software. Software and the transmission of applicable data, if any, is subject to United States export controls. No Software may be downloaded from the Service or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Using the Software is at your sole risk. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules and laws regarding your use of the Service, including as it concerns online conduct and acceptable content. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interface that is provided by HookFeed for use in accessing the Service. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved and no license or right to use any trademark of HookFeed or any third party is granted to you in connection with the Service.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for all data, information, feedback, suggestions, text, content and other materials that you upload, post, deliver, publish, provide or otherwise link, transmit or store (hereafter "post(ing)") in connection with or relating to the Service ("Your Content"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password and account and for all activities that occur under your login or account. HookFeed reserves the right to access your account in order to respond to your requests for technical support. By posting Your Content on or through the Service, You hereby do and shall grant HookFeed a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display, publish and perform Your Content in connection with the Service. HookFeed has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Service, Content, or Your Content. You further agree that HookFeed may remove or disable any Content at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content), or for no reason at all.</p>

<p>You understand that the operation of the Service, including Your Content, may be unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices; (c) transmission to HookFeed's third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Service and (d) transmission to certain Third-Party Services (as defined in below). Accordingly, you acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Your Content. HookFeed will have no liability to you for any unauthorized access or use of any of Your Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction or loss of any of Your Content.</p>

<p>The failure of HookFeed to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this TOS shall not be a waiver of that right. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and HookFeed, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and HookFeed, and it governs your use of the Service and takes the place of any prior agreements between you and HookFeed. If any provision of this TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this TOS remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>HookFeed may ask to use your name and/or company name as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on HookFeed's website and in other communication with existing or potential HookFeed customers. HookFeed will contact you if we wish to do so.</p>

<p>The Service enables connections to various online third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). To take advantage of these feature and capabilities, we may ask you to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers. For more information about the implications of activating these Third-Party Services and HookFeed's use, storage and disclosure of information related to you and your use of Third-Party Services within HookFeed, please see our Privacy Policy at <a href="../privacy-policy/index.html">http://www.hookfeed.com/privacy-policy</a>. However, please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties.</p>

<p>The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links or other access to other sites and resources on the Internet (including without limitation Third-Party Services). HookFeed has no control over such sites and resources and HookFeed is not responsible for and does not endorse such sites and resources. You further acknowledge and agree that HookFeed will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, events, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource. Any dealings you have with third parties found while using the Service are between you and the third party, and you agree that HookFeed is not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against any such third party.</p>

<p>To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is made available for any fee, you will be required to select a payment plan and provide HookFeed information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to HookFeed that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay HookFeed the amount that is specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and this TOS. You hereby authorize HookFeed to bill your payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges you must let HookFeed know within sixty (60) days after the date that HookFeed bills you. We reserve the right to change HookFeed's prices. If HookFeed does and you are on active payment plan, you will have the option to continue using HookFeed at the previous price.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant to HookFeed that (i) you have full power and authority to enter into this TOS; (ii) you own all Your Content or have obtained all permissions, releases, rights or licenses required to engage in your posting and other activities (and allow HookFeed to perform its obligations) in connection with the Services without obtaining any further releases or consents; (iii) Your Content and other activities in connection with the Service, and HookFeed's exercise of all rights and license granted by you herein, do not and will not violate, infringe, or misappropriate any third party's copyright, trademark, right of privacy or publicity, or other personal or proprietary right, nor does Your Content contain any matter that is defamatory, obscene, unlawful, threatening, abusive, tortious, offensive or harassing; and (iv) you are eighteen (18) years of age or older.</p>

<p>You have the right to terminate your account at any time in accordance with the procedures set forth on the Site. HookFeed reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and (ii) refuse any and all current and future use of the Service, suspend or terminate your account (any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any of Your Content in the Service, for any reason, including if HookFeed believes that you have violated this TOS. HookFeed shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service. HookFeed will use good faith efforts to contact you to warn you prior to suspension or termination of your account by HookFeed. All of Your Content on the Service (if any) may be permanently deleted by HookFeed upon any termination of your account in its sole discretion. If HookFeed terminates your account without cause and you have signed up for a fee-bearing service, HookFeed will refund the pro-rated, unearned portion of any amount that you have prepaid to HookFeed for such Service. However, all accrued rights to payment shall survive termination of this TOS.</p>

<p>THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE SITE AND CONTENT, AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND HookFeed EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HookFeed DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE AND NO INFORMATION, ADVICE OR SERVICES OBTAINED BY YOU FROM HookFeed OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS TOS.</p>

<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL HookFeed BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR (B) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE to YOUR CLAIM or, IF NO FEES APPLY, one hundred ($100) U.S. dollars. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TOS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS TOS.</p>

<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. IN THESE STATES, HookFeed'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

<p>You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless HookFeed from and against any claims, actions or demands, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of this TOS, any of Your Content, or your other access, contribution to, use or misuse of the Service. HookFeed shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit or demand. HookFeed reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting HookFeed's defense of such matter. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>

<p>At HookFeed's or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this TOS or the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in San Diego County, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator's decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in this TOS and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under this TOS, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This TOS shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. Unless otherwise elected by HookFeed in a particular instance, you hereby expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located within San Diego County, California for the purpose of resolving any dispute relating to your access to or use of the Service not subject to arbitration, as set forth above. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or this TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
